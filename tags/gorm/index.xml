      <description>If youâ€™ve ever written code in Golang that interfaces with the database, chances are that you already know GORM. With GORM, creating, updating, deleting records is super simple.
 But GORM offers a lot more than just basic database operations. One of my favourites is the ability to attach database Hooks. Database hooks can be used to do all kinds of cool stuff like automatically deleting records created by test fixtures, logging information about when a record was inserted/deleted, updating records in one table when another is changed and so on.</description>
